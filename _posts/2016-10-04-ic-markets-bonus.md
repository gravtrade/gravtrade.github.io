## Breaking down Forex bonus

Trading bonus is the amount of money that you get from you trading broker or external party (in this case GravTrade as an IB) after you comply certain of requirements. The money came from trading commission that you pay to broker every time you open and closed your trade calculated in "Round Trip". By getting bonus from GravTrade, you could earn maximum USD4000 each month.

## Reduce your trading cost

While getting in and out on any market instrument you need to pay sum amount of broker commission, which included inside your account chart spread for (IC Markets Standard Fixed Spread Account) or separated (IC Markets True ECN Account).

Some of smart active trader will look for another alternative way that could give an advantage to their trading journey by applying bonus or rebates against their trading account and this would maximize their monthly gains, trading performance and risk ratio.
