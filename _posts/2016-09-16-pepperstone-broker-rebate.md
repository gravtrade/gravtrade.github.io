# How to get rebate from Pepperstone Broker?
As a Forex Trader, reducing your trading cost is a part of game. To get in and out in market, you need to pay sum ammount of commission to your Forex Broker (this is how they run their business) and this would reduce your profits if you closing position on profit or adding to your risk if you on loosing side. By applying to our **Pepperstone Rebate**, you could get back sum of the ammount that you paid to broker! 

If you trade 1000 standard lot monthly and the commission was $7 per lot, your trading cost would be $7000. While if you get $0.25 rebate per lot, you will get 3.6% commission discount for 1000 lot every month! If dont think this is as an opportunity, just think how much you cost your money by paying broker commission and paying swap?

Follow steps below:

1. Sign up Pepperstone Standard account through our IB [Here](https://pepperstone.com/?a_aid=pro "Here") and you will get 0.25usd for every 1 Standard Lot traded.
2. If you already have pepperstone account, you need to email pepperstone support and ask them to put you under our IB id (pro) or provide them this link (https://pepperstone.com/?a_aid=pro) into your mail.
3. Email us once you comply our monthly minimum traded volume (1000 lot) each end of month.
