If you looking for **USD4 Standard Account IC Markets Rebate**, go [Here](http://www.gravtrade.com/icmarkets/rebate/2016/10/04/ic-markets-rebate-standard-account.html "Standard Account IC Markets Rebate").

As a Forex Trader, reducing your trading cost is a part of the game. To get in and out in market, you need to pay sum ammount of commission to your Forex Broker (this is how they run their business) and this would reduce your profits if you closing position on profit or adding to your risk if you on loosing side. By applying to our **ECN Account IC Markets Rebate**, you could get back sum of the ammount that you paid to broker!

If you trade 3000 standard lot monthly and the commission was USD7 per lot, your trading cost would be USD21000. While if you get 0.2 pips (USD2) rebate per lot, you will get 29% (USD6000) commission discount for 3000 lot every month! If you don't think this is as an opportunity, just think how much you cost your money by paying a broker commission and swap?

1. Sign up **IC Markets True ECN Account** through our IB [Here](http://www.icmarkets.com/forex-trading/open-a-live-account/?camp=7746 "Here") and you will get USD2 rebate for every 1 Standard Lot traded.
